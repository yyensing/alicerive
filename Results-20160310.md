# Results from March 10 2016

These results were obtained on an HP EliteBook Folio 9480m (quad core 2.9GHz
64-bit Intel i7 CPU; 16GB RAM).

**Verdicts:**

* Go loads the replies from disk the fastest (< half a second).
* Go and Python are both slow at fetching a reply, and take about the same
  amounts of time for equivalent inputs.
* Perl takes the second longest to load replies from disk, but it replies in
  under one second the majority of the time.
* Python is the slowest at loading Alice from disk, but only barely longer than
  Perl.
* JavaScript is pretty fast all around (2-3s loading time, reply in less than
  half a second in most cases), but it's more prone to deep recursion errors
  (see Misc Notes on the main README). It also seems prone to memory leaks --
  each subsequent reload of RiveScript takes about twice as long as the previous
  one.

## Go

Go v1.5.3 / RiveScript v0.0.2

Note: I uncovered a bug when testing this where `{@...}` inline redirects
wouldn't substitute correctly resulting in an infinite loop. Fixed as of v0.0.2!
